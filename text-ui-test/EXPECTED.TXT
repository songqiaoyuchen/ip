Hi! I'm Ding from the highlands. I'm 20 years young :)
Welcome to my world! Still learning English, just like my horse Pearl learning to trot!
========================================
Ding: Got it! Task has been added to my little notebook:
[T][ ] do work
You now have 1 tasks. Keep grinding, worker!
(Every step forward counts, even on the steepest trail!)
========================================
Ding: I couldn't understand that date/time. Try formats like 2019-12-02 1800 or 2/12/2019.
========================================
Ding: I'd love to add that deadline! Just use: deadline <description> /by <when>

(Mission accomplished! Time for some sweet tea reward!)

Ding: Noted, I've returned this task to 'pending':

(Slow and steady wins the race!)

Ding: Here's your current task list:

1. [T][ ] do work

========================================
Ding: Hmm, I can't seem to find that task...
(Maybe it wandered off like a free-spirited horse?)
